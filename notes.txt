docker version is in git/docker-weewx and is a lightly-modified version of
https://github.com/tomdotorg/docker-weewx (his only goes up to 4.6.2 in github,
but 4.8 in dockerhub.)
 
NO usb support, so if we need that we should go here: https://github.com/felddy/weewx-docker/issues/16
--net=host \
  --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 \
  --device=/dev/ttyAMA0 \

weewx.conf is in data dir, because you can't change/rename mounted volume-files
beause of inodes (docker limitation)

Keep in mind if you try to do ./setup.py install from ~/src of a built image,
it will fail because of the above limitation (tries to rename user to user.bak,
etc). From inspection of the setup process (which also does upgrades), it only
renames/backs stuff up and doesn't make any changes to user, thus the
wee_config --upgrade command should be sufficient (no idea how databases get
upgraded, but it's not in setup.py


you will also need to upgrade after build/run if version in weewx.conf
if the version in weewx.conf doesn't match version you are installing (from an
already built system
# /home/weewx/bin/wee_config --upgrade --dist-config /home/weewx/weewx.conf.4.8.0 /data/weewx.conf

Install plugins
# install plugins - NOTE, you need to do this after you build because user dir
# is mounted only after build/run

You may need to do this to upgrade:

./shell.sh
/usr/bin/sv -w 5 force-stop /etc/service/*
ps -ef | grep weewxd  and kill
cd /home/weewx/src
